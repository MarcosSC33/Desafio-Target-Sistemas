# Resolution of Challenges.
## Each folder contains the codes of the resolution of the respective challenge. 
## The language used was Java.
## OBS.: In the daily billing challenge of the distributor (question 3), in the calculation of the lowest daily billing, the days in which there was no billing were disregarded. Also added the json-simple-1.1.1.jar file to this project's library for reading the JSON file.
